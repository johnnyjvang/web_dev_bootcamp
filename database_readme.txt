how to choose a database? 
- there are a lot! not easy to choose from 
- main differences: SQL or NoSQL
- SQL = sequel, strucutered query language 
	- MySQL, PostgreSQL
- NoSQL = not only strcutured query language 
	- mongoDB, redis 

- SQL = database looks like a table or excell (cvs) file 
	- inputs "null" for all non-given parameters 
	- old and reliable 
	- relational 
		- could combine multiple tables together 

- NoSQL = javascript type objects (JSON) 
	- new and flashy-er
	- more flexible  
	- not good with relationships (non-relational) 	
		- can use references to be like relationships 

Scalability!

MySQL vs MongoDB 

NoSQL = good scalability 
	- shiny and new
	- document stucture
	- more flexible to changes 
	- not great with complex relationships 
	- horizontally scalable 

SQL = gets slower the more rows of data you have 
	- more mature
	- table structure
	- requires a schema 
	- great with relationships 
	- scales vertically
